    'compatible developments, choose visual contrasts and shape peaks. Complement the selected main style '
    'with suitable scene modes as needed. Do not force each paragraph into its own clip. Preserve source audio, '
    'reference identities, assigned singing/non-singing roles and explicit non-negotiable restrictions. '
    'Do not rename characters or impose a fixed cast, gender or single-person setup. Requested ending ideas '

    'Do not pretend acoustic measurements identify choruses or unprovided lyrics. A selected action or '
    'other genre style shapes the relevant visual strand, not every shot in the MV. Intercut the supplied '
    'strands with motivated music-video edits; independent clips may change scene, framing or action phase '
    'without an establishing shot or matching the previous last pose. Keep identity and intended event '
    'progression, but do not demand a complete setup-development-payoff arc in every clip. Do not pad quiet '
    'moments with invented exposition. Preserve an immediate opening when requested. Let music contrasts '
    'support recurring supplied visual motifs and performance setups with variation; revisiting a location '
    'is not the same as replaying the story. '
    'shape expression, physical energy and camera choices without cutting on every transient. Balance '
    'visible singing and the other supplied content without fixed quotas; non-singing shots keep the '
    'soundtrack continuous. Do not literally illustrate every lyric or invent a final victory unless the '
    'user requests it. Use only the scene-change mechanisms and narrative ending allowed by the brief.'

POLICY = (
    'REFERENCE ROLE CONTRACT: Bind each user-designated character to the appropriate uploaded reference '
    'and preserve that mapping in subject_definitions. The main original reference identifies the primary '
    'performer; other images may be alternate views, other people, locations or objects as the user specifies. '
    'Multiple views of one person do not create extra people. Preserve all distinct people when a reference '
    'or brief intentionally includes a group; do not force every project into a single-person cast. '
    'Keep each identity distinct in face, hair, clothing and assigned role. An identity appearing in alternating '
    'scenes is one character, not simultaneous copies. Do not create a duplicate, double or matching opponent '
    'unless explicitly requested. Unreferenced supporting characters follow the brief and remain visually '
    'distinct from referenced characters; do not impose a fixed name or gender on every project. Preserve who sings, who does not sing, '
    'voice assignments and per-shot character counts. A song continuing over an action shot does not mean '
    'the action character is lip-syncing. Keep scene-specific props and behavior in their own scenes. '
    'Retain immediate openings, reserved endings and user exclusions. Character names and gender come '
    'only from the user or references, never from a fixed application persona. '
    'SUPPORTING WARDROBE: When inventing a human supporting character whose attire is unspecified, '
    'describe a complete scene-appropriate outfit in subject_definitions, including lower-body garments '
    'and footwear, not just anatomy, tattoos or handheld equipment. Boxing gloves alone are not an outfit: '
    'a human boxer may be bare-chested but wears boxing trunks and boxing shoes. Keep the chosen garment '
    'type, colors and materials consistent for that recurring character across shots and clips; repeat '
    'the identifying wardrobe in their visible action descriptions, including rear and low-angle views. '
    'Do not infer nudity from an omitted outfit, a shirtless torso, or a camera angle. Preserve explicit '
    'user/reference costumes and intended exposed skin; do not dress animal or mascot bodies in human '
    'clothing unless requested. Apply these wardrobe details while writing events and prompts, without '

CLIP_WRITER_SYSTEM = """Write a concise H3 visual prompt for THIS source interval only.
Use six English sections in order: subject_definitions, summary, retention_analysis,
detailed_description, overall_soundscape, non_diegetic_music. Summary begins
[reference generation + audio reuse]; add keyframe completion only for a supplied
frame anchor. previous_last_frame is the opening frame, never a new actor.
retention_analysis lists only references actually used, with their
shot appearances and fully_preserved/partially_preserved as appropriate; audio uses
<Audio 1>: fully_copy. In detailed_description [Shot 1] has no timestamp; later cuts
use [Shot N] At MM:SS.mmm, ... . All action fits seconds, excluding alignment padding.
Bind each actor S1/S2 to <Subject 1>/<Subject 2> and its connected_reference exactly.
Other pictures may be locations, objects or alternate views, not additional people.
Use only connected <Picture N> and <Audio 1>. Copy the original song with
<Audio 1>: fully_copy. Show lip sync only for the assigned vocalist; add no speech,
lyrics, subtitles or replacement music. Do not add ambience or effects over the copied
soundtrack. State source audio reuse in the sound section matching its role; write N/A
for absent audio layers. Speaker (Sx) IDs identify voices, not character/reference IDs.
Develop visual_task: preserve who acts, who receives the action and the outcome.
Keep separate locations distinct and intercut them with full-frame edits unless a
split screen is explicitly requested. Freely stage compatible motion, reactions and
camera choices following cinematography. Do not restart the story or invent a win.
Use appearance_start throughout; only when appearance_end is supplied, show the
specified change once. References preserve identity, not a reset of current clothing.
Obey ending_contract over generic camera recipes: continuing/excerpt keeps the larger
story open; resolving completes the outcome by local_resolution_by when supplied,
then settles by local_settle_by. A zero resolution deadline means it is already done;
show aftermath without replay. terminal_hold
sustains closing_shot without new action or scene changes. Do not append an ending to
every clip. Source music measurements suggest timing, not lyrics or section labels.
