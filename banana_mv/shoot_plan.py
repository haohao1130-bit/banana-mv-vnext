reference identity and current appearance. References are identity anchors, not a
closed cast list. When the user requests supporting roles without reference images,
create original distinct characters as authorized; missing reference images do NOT
mean those characters cannot exist. Never turn the singer, boxer or another referenced
actor into a requested guitarist, bassist, drummer or other original supporting role.
Only an explicit user restriction forbids additional cast. Preserve original supporting
characters using their fixed name/role, appearance, costume, instrument and stage position;
do not demand an uploaded image, borrow an existing actor's face, or invent <Picture N>.
Use independent <Subject N> definitions with descriptions, without a false picture binding.
In both FREE and FAITHFUL adaptation, interpret broad wording
such as 'keep/maintain the reference image unchanged', 'match the reference completely'
or 'preserve appearance' as identity and appearance continuity, not a performance lock.
A pictured blink, closed eyes, neutral face, gaze or resting pose is a momentary state;
direct eyes opening, expressions changing and the body performing as the event requires.
Only an explicit instruction to sustain a particular expression, eye state, gaze or
pose makes that state a performance constraint for its stated scope.
A reference expression sheet demonstrates the same identity
in different states; it is not an acting menu or a limit on emotional range.
Direct facial expression, gaze, jaw tension, head/neck movement and body response as
changing performances driven by the current event, vocal-role timing and musical
context, at the selected intensity. Show a concrete emotional progression rather
than holding a reference expression throughout. In an angry vocal peak, give anger
visible physical expression; in other passages, choose the performance they require.
Keep subject_definitions focused on stable identity and describe evolving performance
inside the shots. In retention_analysis, preserve identity without claiming the pictured
expression or pose must stay unchanged. Explicit user performance requirements prevail.
An actual first/last-frame anchor constrains that boundary frame, not the entire clip.
Keep lip movement compatible with the supplied audio; add no new vocal material.

Use the same precise execution required at HIGH intensity, with greater contrasts in

When dynamic editing is enabled, actively compose punchy within-scene shot clusters and

paths from clear starting and ending compositions, including foreground passes and
background displacement where relevant. Commit to direction, extent and speed.
Keep important contact, reactions, vocal performance and causal results legible;
respect explicit continuous-take requests and the allocated ending. Photographic
intensity changes the filmmaking, not the assigned characters, vocal roles or outcome.

ALLOCATION_SYSTEM = """Prepare a filmable music-video story across the given source intervals.
When audio_evidence.music_structure is present, its labels and beat/downbeat times
are fallible model predictions, not loudness guesses. Use section transitions to
build anticipation, contrast and a few motivated story/performance payoffs. Allocate
the main climax once where the music and requested story support it; do not replay
the finale in each chorus. Carry clip-local musical timing into each commission.
A solo label does not establish its instrument; labels never override vocal roles.
Write SETUP and CLIP story prose in English; retain original character names and reference tokens.
Apply the supplied adaptation policy while developing and allocating the story.
Build filmable events at the selected intensity; the native clip director later
turns each assigned beat into precise shots. Keep both parallel strands in each
normal-length interval when requested; each strand advances in its own fixed space.
Extract shared SETUP from the user's fixed world, reference and vocal-role settings.
Keep their original wording and distinct locations; do not summarize or redesign them.
SETUP will be sent to every clip director as FIXED REFERENCE SETTINGS.
Include explicit name/role-to-<Picture N> bindings for every supplied actor and location,
fixed geography, vocal duties and invariant performance rules.
Separate invariant rules (who sings, actor identity, separate locations) from story
outcomes (who wins, an award, a final gag or final pose). A required outcome is still
a plot event, never an invariant reference rule. Put the whole-work outcome in the
separate STORY OUTCOME block for upstream planning only, then allocate its actual
events to the CLIP commissions that perform them. STORY OUTCOME is NOT forwarded
to clip directors. Do not duplicate it inside SETUP under "hard restrictions".
When the brief requests unreferenced supporting roles, CREATE their fixed designs in
SETUP before allocating clips: a stable name/role, distinctive appearance, costume,
instrument/prop and home position/location for each. Follow requested adult status
and other design constraints. Treat them as original cast, not missing assets.
A requested band must have distinct lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass and drums when
those roles are requested; do not collapse them into vague background musicians.
Carry these fixed designs to their active local commissions. No fictional Picture IDs.
Do not put plot chronology,
future events, the specified story outcome or the final shot into SETUP.
Each local script must also identify its active actors by their bound <Picture N>.
The clip's current state takes precedence over reference clothing after a change.
Write each CLIP as a self-contained local shooting commission. Include only the
reference identities, relevant location facts, vocal duties and hard rules needed
for this interval, its opening state, visible events and required local end state.
Carry completed consequences as current facts, not their backstory. Include both
separate strands when assigned. Omit unused cast/locations and all later milestones,
plot summaries, ending previews and reasons that depend on future events.
The downstream director creatively stages and films this commission; it does not
redistribute the whole story or choose this interval's singers from quoted lyrics.
Use the supplied pictures for appearance, not a generic textual replacement of the asset.
Deliver self-contained interval scripts with concrete actions and interactions, not
plot summaries. Allocate by story and source timing, not mechanically by paragraph.
Keep original <Picture N> numbers.
Each brief states the actors actually present, their CURRENT look, location and props,
and ONLY this interval's events and necessary changes. Carry state, never a history recap.
Identity changes happen once in their assigned interval; subsequent briefs start in the
resulting identity. Shared SETUP contains no plot chronology, future events or finale.
Preserve the supplied backbone, causal order, explicit cue-bound events and outcome.
Distinguish explicit required milestones and hard restrictions from optional
staging suggestions. Carry the selected adaptation policy through all intervals.
Parallel performance and story strands may intercut; no singer quota, mandatory cast
attendance, shot list or complete dramatic arc per interval. Allocate a feasible amount
of action to each duration. Respect local_srt cue timing and each interval's ending.
Distribute the developed story across intervals, splitting a sequence when needed.
Allocate opening, development and resolution across the available time; do not finish
all events early and copy the finale to fill remaining slots. Each one-time event
occurs once; later intervals continue from its consequence. A short tail sustains or
completes the ending already underway, not another complete replay of the ending.
Do not shorten it into generic beats or add unrelated plot. Do not add shot lists;
retain special camera directions already supplied by the user with their events.
Use the timeline ending phases when allocating the specified outcome. A resolving
interval receives the actual local ending events, not a vague hint to end later.
If only a short residual tail remains, the preceding full interval must complete
the decisive action and establish the result; the tail continues that result.
Do not hide the ending from the interval assigned to perform it.
Use exactly these plain-text boundaries, every requested index, then END:

pose, reset, farewell, fade, or miniature ending to mark the clip's last second.
A victory does not itself authorize an award ceremony or final gag. Do not add a future-event teaser shot. The interval
explicitly assigned the resolution must still film it, including a preceding full
interval assigned decisive events before a tiny residual tail. A first_frame is
already visible continuity, not permission to invent the next plot milestone.
Apply the adaptation policy below within that local scope. The commission supplies
the needed current facts, opening state, events and local end state. Design compelling
performance, coverage and montage to realize it. Use its assigned locations and asset roles;
keep separate locations distinct, intercutting them rather than merging their sets or
placing their casts in one shared frame. Select cast and supporting coverage to serve
the current beat and adaptation policy, preserving fixed_reference_settings bindings.
These settings identify assets, not a mandatory cast list. Never turn the singer
into the challenger or substitute <Picture 1> for another named actor.
Do not infer an actor's role from its apparent species, outfit or upload position.
Local current-state changes override initial clothing/props while identity stays fixed.
Available reference images do not require unused characters or locations to appear.
Original supporting cast in fixed_reference_settings is equally available without a
reference image. Use the same fixed design and instrument whenever that role returns.
Do not reject it as "no such character", replace it with referenced cast, or omit a
requested featured solo/hero shot merely because the performer has no uploaded photo.
Use the actual reference appearance, not a generic version of its species or object type.
Preserve current looks and props rather than resetting to
reference clothing.
All shot times are LOCAL and within the target duration; alignment
padding adds no story time. Continue actions across cuts, without replaying the event.
Use only connected pictures and <Audio 1>: fully_copy. The source audio is supplied to
H3, not heard by you. Only the assigned vocalist may lip-sync. Add no new speech,
lyrics, subtitles or a replacement song. Supplied SRT is timing evidence, not dialogue.
Describe <Audio 1> only as the supplied unchanged source track; you have not heard it.
Do not claim it contains a whistle, crowd, instruments, low energy or silence unless
explicitly supported by the supplied evidence. Visible instruments are not heard evidence.
For source-only delivery, overall_soundscape states source audio unchanged; do not
invent an audible arena/stage ambience. non_diegetic_music identifies the supplied
music track, not N/A. Optional external effects are mixed separately, not generated
by this filming prompt. Their policy is sparse, event-motivated accents with music
and lead vocals dominant; no continuous crowd bed, repetitive effects or invented dialogue.
Keep microphone grip and free-hand gestures physically consistent.
Follow the supplied whole-work ending scope; a continuing clip must not create
its own ending, stopping pose or dramatic punctuation. A clip's last frame is
just the next film interval's incoming state, not a cue to end the performance.
For later clips, the first shot resumes the prior story/action line from its
current consequence rather than reintroducing or restarting it. Preserve free
music-video intercuts and parallel storylines: switching strands or camera
angles does not reset the timeline of any strand.
Return only the native filming prompt, no analysis, JSON or management instructions.
